<p>This page documents the policy to request re-computation of SAM availabilities results for WLCG and EGI. Current policy was approved on 14/02/2012.</p>

<p>Problems affecting the monitoring infrastructure may incorrectly impact the availability results for a given site during a period of time. When these issues are confirmed the test results must be verified or sometimes updated. The availability results are then re-computed so that availability numbers are not affected by the monitoring infrastructure fault.</p>


<h3><a name="AvailabilityRe-computationPolicy-Conditionstorequestarecomputation"></a>Conditions to request a re-computation</h3>

<p>Requests for re-computation are only accepted:</p>
<ul>
	<li>When failures are due to problems in the monitoring infrastructure (invalid proxy certificate, problems in SE used for replica tests, etc);</li>
	<li>When reported up to 10 calendar days after the announcement of the reports of a given month, which normally occurs on 1st of the following month.</li>
</ul>


<p>Below are some examples to better explain the conditions above:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Example 1
	<ul>
		<li>On 25-Jan-2012 region A requests the re-computation of the region availability due to a hardware problem on SAM-Nagios which happend on 15-Jan-2012.</li>
		<li>The request is approved. The justification of the problem is valid and the request was reported on time (before the announcement of the report).</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Example 2
	<ul>
		<li>On 05-Feb-2012 site B requests the re-computation of the site availability due to a problem with the host certificate of SAM-Nagios which happend on 15-Jan-2012.</li>
		<li>The request is approved. The justification of the problem is valid and the problem was reported on time (5 days after the announcement of the first report).</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Example 3
	<ul>
		<li>On 20-Feb-2012 region C requests the re-computation of the region availability due to a network problem on SAM-Nagios which happend on 15-Jan-2012.</li>
		<li>The request is rejected. The problem was reported too late (more then 10 days after the announcement of the first report).</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>



<h3><a name="AvailabilityRe-computationPolicy-Howtorequestarecomputation"></a>How to request a re-computation</h3>

<p>Confirm that the availability of your site/region is affected by browsing the <a href="http://grid-monitoring.cern.ch/mywlcg/sa/">MyWLCG</a>/<a href="http://grid-monitoring.cern.ch/myegi/sa/">MyEGI</a> service availability interface and open a new <a href="http://www.ggus.org">GGUS</a> ticket:</p>
<ul>
	<li>OPS VO: For EGI sites and regions, please assign the ticket as described in <a href="https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/PROC10?">EGI PROC10</a>;</li>
	<li>OPS VO: For OSG sites, please assign the ticket to&nbsp;SAM/Nagios Support Unit (3rd level experts).</li>
	<li>HEP VOS: For WLCG sites, please assign the ticket to&nbsp;SAM/Nagios Support Unit (3rd level experts).</li>
</ul>


<p>The GGUS ticket must include the following information:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A description of the problem;</li>
	<li>The site or ROC/NGI affected by the problem;</li>
	<li>The start and end time of the problem (yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm in UTC);</li>
	<li>The VO affected by the problem;</li>
	<li>A link to <a href="http://grid-monitoring.cern.ch/mywlcg/sa/">MyWLCG</a>/<a href="http://grid-monitoring.cern.ch/myegi/sa/">MyEGI</a> pointing to the problem.</li>
</ul>


<h3><a name="AvailabilityRe-computationPolicy-Howtofollowarecomputation"></a>How to follow a re-computation</h3>

<p>The deadline for requesting re-computations is 10 calendar days after the announcement of the reports for a given month. Assuming the reports are announced on the 1st of the following month, the deadline for requesting re-computations will be the 11th of that month. As soon as the re-computation is complete the GGUS ticket is closed and the submitter notified. The <a href="http://grid-monitoring.cern.ch/mywlcg/sa/">MyWLCG</a>/<a href="http://grid-monitoring.cern.ch/myegi/sa/">MyEGI</a> service availability interface can be used to confirm the new availability numbers. The final report will be published shortly after the deadline.</p>

<p>If there are no requests for re-computation the first reports published at the beginning of the month are considered final reports. In any case, after the deadline, no further requests will be considered.</p>
